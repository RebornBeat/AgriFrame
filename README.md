# AgriFrame: Universal Modular Agricultural Automation System
*Research Documentation and Concept Exploration*

## Overview

AgriFrame represents a revolutionary approach to agricultural automation through a modular overhead framework system that achieves zero ground pressure while providing comprehensive field coverage. This research explores the possibilities of transforming agriculture from ground-based mechanization to overhead-based automation, examining various configurations, patterns, and operational methodologies.

## Core Innovation

The fundamental innovation lies in recognizing that all agricultural planting patterns can be reduced to line-based geometries that can be serviced by an overhead framework system. By operating entirely above the crop area, the system eliminates soil compaction while enabling automation across diverse terrains and crop types.
